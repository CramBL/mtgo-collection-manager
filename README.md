## Features? Who knows, we'll see what I come up with, and how much time I have.
If you have a great idea, make a feature request via an issue, thanks!
### Feature Ideas:

* **Price alerts** certain sites already have price alerts, but they are kind of crappy and hard to maintain. So better and smarter price alerts is a place to start.
* **Auto fetch users full MTGO collection** might be difficult. MTGO's local user files are a giant mess, it's solvable for sure, but might break quite often depending on how MTGO files are actually managed long term. Could be difficult to handle multiple accounts as well.
* **[A million data driven features]** like giving alerts when a card with a historically stable price suddenly spikes, and stuff like that.
